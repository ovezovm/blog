## The social aspect

This week has been eventful and filled with a variety of impressions. I plunged into the world of art and culture by attending several interesting events. Each of them gave new emotions, reflections and inspiration. Live performances and galleries helped me disconnect from the daily hustle and bustle and rethink the usual things a little.

## Reunion

In the middle of the week, I went home to my parents. These trips always bring a special feeling of peace and comfort. The homely atmosphere and native faces are a real reboot.

## Favorite activity

Well, I ended the week on my favorite note â€” horseback riding. There is nothing better than riding through the fields, feeling freedom and harmony with nature. The time spent with my beloved horses was the perfect point at the end of this busy week.


## The result

It's good that there are such moments!
