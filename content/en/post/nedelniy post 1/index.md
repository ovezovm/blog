## The social aspect

his week started with excitement. I was assigned a new project at work, which involves building a microservice architecture using Python and Docker. 



## Favorite activity

I’ve worked with monolithic systems before, so diving into microservices is both a challenge and an opportunity for growth.

I spent most of the week studying different design patterns, ensuring scalability and resilience in the system. There were moments of frustration, especially when Docker containers wouldn’t behave as expected.

## The result

However, by the end of the week, I managed to get a working prototype of one service. It’s just the beginning, but I’m looking forward to the coming weeks!
