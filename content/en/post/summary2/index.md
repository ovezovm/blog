## First post

This post is an example where I demonstrate that I figured out how to work with posts 2.0.

## Events of the week

The week passed as usual. No deviations from normality were recorded.

## Example of numbering

1. Last week there was a midterm in mathematical analysis.

2. This week there was a test in discrete mathematics.
