## Another exhibition

This week turned out to be intense. After setting up the initial prototype last week, I started integrating the different services. And guess what? Bugs everywhere! The communication between services wasnâ€™t as smooth as I had anticipated.


## Study

I spent hours debugging issues related to network calls between Docker containers and configuring the message broker correctly.

## The result

There were days when I felt like I was chasing ghosts in the code, but slowly things started to make sense. By Friday, I finally managed to fix the majority of the communication issues, and the system is now running more smoothly
