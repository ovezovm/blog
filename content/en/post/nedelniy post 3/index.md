## Refactoring Frenzy

After resolving most of the bugs last week, I realized the codebase had become quite messy. So this week was dedicated to refactoring. I reorganized several modules, cleaned up redundant code, and implemented a more consistent logging system.

It was tedious work, but very satisfying. Seeing the code become more modular and easier to maintain is always rewarding. I also wrote additional unit tests to ensure future changes won’t break anything unexpectedly. Now the code is in much better shape, and I’m confident it’ll be easier to scale and extend.
