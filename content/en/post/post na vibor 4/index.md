# Comments everywhere

We all know how important code comments are, but let’s be honest, we don’t always follow that rule. Last week, I found myself in a situation where comments literally saved my life (or at least my sanity). I was working on an old codebase that I hadn’t touched in months. It was an old project, and as you can guess, I’d forgotten most of it.

When the time came to make changes, I realized that some sections of the code were just impossible to understand at first glance. Luckily, past me had left detailed comments. Honestly, it was the only way I could figure out what I meant back then. Thanks to those comments, I was able to quickly get up to speed and make the necessary changes. Without them, it would’ve taken me twice as long.

The lesson? Never underestimate the power of good comments. When you revisit your code months later (or, even worse, someone else does), comments are your best friend. It’s one of those things that may seem unnecessary during development, but in the long run, they save you a ton of time and stress.
