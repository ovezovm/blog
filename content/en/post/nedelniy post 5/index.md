## Sad

These months at home have passed too quickly. It seemed that he had just met with his family, hugged his parents, sat with friends, and it was time to return to school. It's so strange to realize that you have to leave everything that is so dear again. 

Every corner here is saturated with memories, and every day the departure seems harder. I will miss evenings with my loved ones and walking along familiar streets. Of course, there are new knowledge and opportunities ahead, but leaving home is always difficult.
