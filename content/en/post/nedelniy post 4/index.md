## Unexpected Challenges

This week threw me a curveball. I encountered a serious performance issue during load testing. The system was much slower than expected under heavy traffic. After analyzing the logs, I found that one of the services was causing bottlenecks due to inefficient database queries.

I spent days optimizing those queries, indexing database tables, and implementing caching mechanisms. By the end of the week, the performance improved significantly, but I still feel there’s room for further optimization. It’s been stressful, but I’ve learned a lot about performance tuning.
