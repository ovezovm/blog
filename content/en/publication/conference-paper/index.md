## Research on the topic: "The influence of horse mane color on their behavior in various social groups"

My name is Ikromjon Sattorov, and my colleague who helped with the research is Nick Fury. Our study was devoted to the study of the relationship between the color of the mane of horses and their social behavior in the herd. This is an unusual topic, because no one has previously considered the effect of mane color on the behavioral characteristics of animals in a social environment. We decided to find out whether the color of the mane can influence the status, aggressiveness or hierarchical position of a horse in a group.

The purpose of the study

The purpose of our study is to determine whether there is a relationship between the color of a horse's mane and its social behavior in a group, as well as to understand whether the color of the mane can influence dominant or subordinate roles in the herd.

Research methods

To conduct the study, we gathered a group of 50 horses of various colors, whose mane color ranged from light to dark. The sample included horses of light gray, red, black and white colors. Each group consisted of 10 horses with the same mane color, and they were placed in isolated groups for 30 days for observation.

Observations were carried out daily, and we recorded how the horses interacted with each other depending on the color of the mane. The following parameters were evaluated:

1. Aggressive manifestations — the number of conflicts between individuals.
2. Social interactions — how often the horses showed friendliness (for example, feeding together, caring for each other).
3. Hierarchical behavior — dominant and subordinate roles, who more often occupied leading positions in the group.

We also used video surveillance and tags on each horse to identify participants and collect data throughout the period.

The results of the study

After completing the observations and processing the data, we came to several interesting conclusions. Although there have been no previous studies linking mane color to horse behavior, our study showed that there are certain differences in social interactions depending on the color of the mane.

1. Horses with dark manes (black and dark red color) showed a greater number of aggressive interactions compared to individuals of a light color. They more often occupied dominant positions in the herd and more actively defended their rights to food and territory.
   
2. Horses with light manes (gray and white), on the contrary, showed a more calm behavior. There were fewer conflicts in these groups, and social interactions such as feeding and caring for each other were more frequent. These horses were more likely to occupy subordinate roles, but at the same time demonstrated more developed cooperation skills.

3. The role of the mane color in the herd hierarchy. Horses with dark manes not only showed aggression more often, but also led the hierarchy of groups. They were more likely to take the initiative in choosing pastures and moving the herd. Horses with blond manes, although they did not strive for dominance, often became central figures in peaceful interactions, demonstrating calmness and the ability to cooperate with other members of the herd.

Conclusions

Our research has shown that the color of the mane may play a role in the social behavior of horses. Horses with dark manes tend to be more aggressive and dominate social groups, whereas light-maned individuals exhibit peaceful and cooperative behavior.

Although these results require further research to confirm the correlation between the color of the mane and the behavior of horses in various conditions, we believe that our observations open up a new field of study of the ethology of these animals. Perhaps further experiments will be able to confirm or refute our assumption that the color of the mane may be associated with evolutionary or biological mechanisms that determine the social behavior of horses.

Thus, we propose to delve into the study of this topic in order to better understand how the external signs of animals can influence their social roles and behavioral patterns in a pack.
