## About Me

I was born and grew up in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan.I went to the first grade in 2012 in the secondary specialized school number 16 with advanced study of foreign languages, in particular studied English, Russian, Turkmen, German and Farsi. I participated in the Olympiad in informatics from 8th to 10th grades. Participated in Olympiads in biology, geography and English. I had a good mind by nature and was not happy to do homework because I grasped the topic during the lesson and did not need additional consolidation of knowledge. From 10 to 11 years I practiced chess, there I did not achieve special heights, but for my age I played well. At the age of 12 my brother took me to the basketball section. Basketball became my passion for years to come, all the rest of the time I was developing my skills. As a result, I got the first adult category, won the city championship and several silver medals in the national championship, as well as injuries on my legs of varying severity. At the age of 18, having finished school in my country, I entered PFUR and moved to Moscow. Now I study programming, I am a second-year student and have been living in a new country for a year.
